import UIKit


//: ## Q1: Optionals
class Words {
    var wordA : String!
    var wordB : String!
    
    init (wordA: String?, wordB: String?) {
        self.wordA = wordA
        self.wordB = wordB
    }

//: ### Are the values passed in to the **init** function and those set to the instance
//: ### variables the same type? If not, why?

//: ### No, because the values passed in to the init function are Optionals, whereas the ones set to instance
//: ### variables are Strings. The instance variables are initialized as Optionals that unpack automatically
//: ### instead of needing unpacking later, so the value assigned to them automatically unpacks.


//: ## Q2: Variable Types and Function Types
    class func arePalindromes(_ words: [String]) -> Bool {
        let reversedWords = words.map() {String($0.characters.reversed())}
        let numElements = words.count
        
        for i in 0 ..< numElements {
            if words[i] != reversedWords[i] {
                return false
            }
        }
        return true
    }
//: ### Why does the compiler dislike the **for loop**? Fix it.
//: ### What else is wrong with this function? You may have to refer to (but **not**
//: ### change) the code at the very bottom. Debug the function.


//: ### Ain't nothing wrong with that for loop. arePalindromes are used as type methods, 
//: ### since they are called on by the type itself and not an instance, and so the function
//: ### header needs to be preceeded by "class" to be recognized as such. Also returned true
//: ### at the end so the function works properly.


//: ## Q3: More Functions and Object Initialization
    func isAnagram() -> Bool {
        var countLetters = [Character : Int]() //Line X
        var lenA = self.wordA.characters.count
        var lenB = self.wordB.characters.count
        
        if lenA != lenB {
            return false
        }
        
        var arrA = Array(self.wordA.characters)
        var arrB = Array(self.wordB.characters)
        
        for i in 0...lenA-1 {
            let letter = arrA[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] { //Line Y
                countLetters[letter] = val + 1
            } else {
                countLetters[letter] = 1
            }
        }
        
        for i in 0...lenB-1 {
            let letter = arrB[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] {
                countLetters[letter] = val - 1
            } else {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        for (letter, count) in countLetters {
            if count != 0 {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        return true
    }
//: ### What is the problem with declaring **countLetters** as we do in **Line X**,
//: ### and then using it in **Line Y**? Fix it (by only changing **Line X**).
//: ### What else is wrong with this function? You may have to refer to (but **not**
//: ### change) the code at the very bottom. Debug the function.

//: ### countLetters is never initialized before it is called in Line Y, so in Line X
//: ### I changed it to initialize to an empty dictionary.
//: ### isAnagram() is not a type method as it is called by an instance of the Word class, so removed 
//: ### the "class" in front of the method header.
//: ### The function erroneously returns nil instead of true, so changed to return true.
